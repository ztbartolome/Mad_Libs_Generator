I can lead with pride, I can make us strong.
I'll be satisfied if I play along.
But the voice inside sings a different song.
What is wrong with me?
See the light as it shines on the sea, it's blinding.
But no one knows, how deep it goes.
And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me, and let me know,
What's beyond that line? Will I cross that line?
And the line where the sky meets the sea?
It calls me!
And no one knows, how far it goes.
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me, one day I'll know, how far I'll go.
