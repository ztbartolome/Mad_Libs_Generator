You're walking in the woods
There's no one around and your phone is dead
Out of the corner of your eye, you spot him
(Shia LaBeouf)

He's following you, about thirty feet back
He gets down on all fours and breaks into a sprint
He's gaining on you
(Shia LaBeouf)

You're looking for your car, but you're all turned around
He's almost upon you now, and you can see there's blood on his face
My God, there's blood everywhere!
Running for your life from Shia LaBeouf
He's brandishing a knife, it's Shia LaBeouf
Lurking in the shadows
Hollywood superstar, Shia LaBeouf
Living in the woods, Shia LaBeouf
Killing for sport, Shia LaBeouf
Eating all the bodies
Actual cannibal Shia LaBeouf
