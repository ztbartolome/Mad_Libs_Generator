The story concerns a person named Cinderella.
Cinderella was a young person who was placed in the care of various wicked people who teased her and forced her to do all the chores.
Eventually, Cinderella was rescued by her fairy godmother, who magically created a special outfit for Cinderella to wear to a ball where she met a handsome prince, married him soon afterward and lived happily ever after in a castle.
If you substitute the name "Cinderella" with the name "Sunny Baudelaire" and eliminate the fairy godmother, the special outfit, the ball, the handsome prince, the marriage, and living happily ever after in a castle, you will have a clear idea of Sunny's predicament.
