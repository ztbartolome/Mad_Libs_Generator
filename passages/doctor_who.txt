Winning?
Is that what you think it's about?
I'm not trying to win.
I'm not doing this because I want to beat someone, or because I hate someone, or because I want to blame someone.
It's not because it's fun, God knows it's not because it's easy, and it's not even because it works, because it hardly ever does.
I do what I do because it's right.
Because it's decent.
And above all, it's kind.
It's just that.
Just kind.
If I run away today, good people will die.
If I stand and fight, some of them might live.
Maybe not many, maybe not for long.
Hey, you know, maybe there's no point in any of this at all, but it's the best I can do, so I'm going to do it, and I will stand here doing it until it kills me, and you're going to die, too.
Someday.
