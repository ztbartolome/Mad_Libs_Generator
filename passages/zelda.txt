The place where you now stand was the Golden Land, but evil power turned it into the Dark World.
The wizard has broken the wise men's seal and opened a gate to link the worlds at Hyrule Castle.
In order to save this half of the world, the Light World, you must win back the Golden Power.
You must also rescue the seven maidens who Agahnim sent to the Dark World.
As members of the blood-line of the seven wise men, they have power that will surely help you.
The maidens are locked in hidden dungeons full of evil creatures and dangerous traps.
The Palace of Darkness should be your first goal in this world!
Link, I can rely on only you.
Please make this old man's wishes come true.
I beg you!
